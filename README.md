In this project I created a simple blog system using the basics of Ruby on Rails including:

* Models, Views, and Controllers (MVC)

* System dependencies

* Data Structures & Relationships

* Routing

* Migrations

* Views with forms, partials, and helper

* RESTful design

* Adding gems for extra features
